# Aenigma üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Name]

### Project Description
Aenigma is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to be a collection of unsolvable puzzles and delightfully frustrating mini-games. It's a journey into chaos, where logic is optional and the goal is to embrace the absurdity.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world saturated with apps that boost productivity and offer clear solutions, we identified a glaring gap in the market: there's no app that actively wastes your time in the most confusing way possible. Users are tragically underserved in their quest for digital pointlessness.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Aenigma is our answer. We've crafted an experience filled with shifting mazes, paradoxical sequences, and buttons that defy user input. It‚Äôs a sanctuary for those who want to question their sanity, one unsolvable puzzle at a time.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used : Dart
- Frameworks used : Flutter
- Libraries used :
    * awesome_dialog: For creating stylish and unhelpful pop-up messages.
    * flutter_fireworks: To celebrate the user's confusion with pretty explosions.
    * crossword: For the unsolvable crossword puzzle.
- Tools used

For Hardware:
Not applicable for this software project.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ajallen14/Aenigma.git

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
### The main screen, where interactive buttons float chaotically, inviting the user into the madness.

### The "Illogical Path" game, where the maze and controls shift randomly, ensuring no escape.

### The "Unstable Tower" game, a physics-based stacking game designed to collapse under the weight of its own chaos.
